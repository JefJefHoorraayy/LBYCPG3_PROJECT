                    <p class="text-break content-paragraph">The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering (DECE) is one of the largest 
                        departments in the Gokongwei College of Engineering at De La Salle University. 
                        Currently, the department has twenty-six academic personnel, one non-academic 
                        personnel, and eight support personnel providing technical, professional and 
                        administrative services. Different laboratories have been established for each 
                        area of specialization. A number of specialized modern research equipment was acquired 
                        from the Department of Science and Technology through the Engineering and Science 
                        Education Program. The equipment is used by the personnel and students for research 
                        and development.<br><br>

                        The Research Center of the Department will also provide consultancy services to 
                        industry, it also conducts industrially relevant research. During the starting 
                        phase, the Center will identify research areas which have elements of research, 
                        service, and development. The results from the research in an identified area 
                        should be available as a service to our local industry. Aside from undertaking 
                        collaborative research projects with industry, the Research Center of the ECE 
                        department also aims to train industry-oriented researchers and engineers through 
                        seminars or short course training.</p><br>

                        The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering offers Electronics 
                        Engineering (ECE) and Computer Engineering (CpE) programs. The department 
                        envisions the ECE and CpE graduates as competent and ethical professionals in the 
                        area they have chosen.  For the ECE, the areas are in Electronics, Communications, 
                        and Digital Signal Processing.  For the CpE, the areas are in Embedded Systems, 
                        Computer Hardware Architecture, Computer Networks, Multimedia Systems and Machine 
                        Learning.
