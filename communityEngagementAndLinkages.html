                  <p>The Adopt-an-Eng program for Unibersidad de Manila (UDM) started last 3rd Term AY 2014-15. 
                    Another batch was accommodated last 1st Term AY 2015-16. This project provided reinforcing lectures 
                    for the students and faculty of the adopted school. We allowed them to use our laboratory facilities 
                    and assisted them during those laboratory activities. A list of laboratory subjects and experiments 
                    that have been identified and were conducted at DLSU ECE/CpE Laboratories. UDM were asked to send the 
                    syllabus for each of the subjects and the visits of the students were properly planned, coordinated and 
                    scheduled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last August 11 and 12, 2017, another round of adopt-an-eng for UDM was conducted. The ECE Department 
                    has provided several laboratory activities to the UDM ECE faculty and 3rd year and 4th year ECE and CpE 
                    students for two days (Friday and Saturday). There were a total of one-hundred seventy (170) UDM students 
                    who were given a chance to use DLSU's Electronics and Communications laboratory facilities to perform basic 
                    and advanced electronics and computer engineering experiments. Students were grouped and lab activities were 
                    performed by batch.
