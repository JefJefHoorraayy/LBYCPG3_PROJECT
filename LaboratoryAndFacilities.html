                          <td>The Unit Operations Laboratory serves the needs of undergraduate students in chemical engineering. 
                            Typical experiments cover topics in fluid mechanics (such as pump characteristics and fluid agitation),
                             heat transfer (such as radiation), mass transfer operations (such as diffusivities, binary distillation,
                              gas absorption, humidification, drying, adsorption), mechanical separation (such as filtration, screening, size reduction), 
                              and other related topics like reaction engineering (such as plug flow or tubular reactor). 
                              In addition, routine sample preparation and separation, as part of preliminary procedures in research, 
                              are often performed here, such as size reduction, centrifugation, drying, elevated heating, sieving and weighing, 
                              and catalyst preparation.</td>
